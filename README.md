# Hotel Booking Analysis üè®üìä

Welcome to the **Hotel Booking Analysis** project! This project dives deep into the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of hotel bookings to uncover patterns and trends that can assist hotels in **maximizing revenue** and reducing **cancellations**. Whether you're a data enthusiast or in the hotel industry, this analysis offers valuable insights for **data-driven decisions**.  

---

## üìù Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Hotel Booking dataset** that contains information for both city and resort hotels. With **1,19,390 observations** and **32 variables**, the data includes critical details such as booking dates, length of stay, the number of guests, and other booking characteristics. 

### Key Outcomes:
- **Understanding cancellations**: Identifying trends to reduce booking cancellations.
- **Optimizing ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: Strategic insights to adjust pricing and maximize profitability.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure
Our analysis follows these steps:
- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and formatting the dataset for accuracy.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Examining individual variables.
- **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**: Exploring relationships and interactions between variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Using charts and graphs to reveal insights.

Each step is carefully designed to uncover meaningful insights that align with the business objectives.

---

## üéØ Business Objective
In the competitive hotel industry, understanding cancellations and optimizing ADR is critical to success. We aim to:
- **Reduce Cancellations**: By identifying patterns, hotels can develop strategies (e.g., flexible policies) to minimize cancellations.
- **Maximize ADR**: By analyzing the factors affecting ADR, hotels can adjust their pricing strategies for better revenue outcomes.

## üîç Key Insights from the Analysis
Here are the main takeaways from the data:

### 1. **üìÖ Best Time to Book a Hotel**
We identified the **months with the highest and lowest ADR**, helping hotels to develop seasonal pricing strategies.

### 2. **‚è≥ Optimal Length of Stay**
The relationship between **length of stay** and **ADR** helps determine the most cost-effective booking durations for guests.

### 3. **üîß Special Requests**
Hotels can predict and manage high-volume **special requests**, improving customer service and reducing cancellations.
